       .DESCRIPTION
       This script first checks if Outlook is running and closes it if necessary. It then creates a new Outlook profile named as defined in the variable in the registry and sets it as the default profile. 
       After that, it launches Outlook with this newly created profile         
          
       

       .NOTES
       Please note that this script is for Outlook 2016+ (Office 16.0). If you’re using a different version of Office, you’ll need to adjust the registry path accordingly. 
       Also, please be aware that modifying the registry can have serious consequences if not done correctly. Always make sure to back up your registry before making any changes.
